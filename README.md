# lua-obfuscation-research
All of _my_ code should be considered under GPLv3. 


Code generated using my code should not be used as copy-protection, DRM, etc., or anything else to obscure reverse engineering. I did this for research. If someone uses this to obfuscate their code, and it is within legal bounds (i.e., you are a security researcher unfamiliar with Lua, and this was used maliciously) and you would like assistance reverse engineering code generated by this, feel free to ask me for help. Though I very highly doubt that you will need it.
