Things I wrote on the bus, as a fork of XFuscator (by mlnlover11) to 
experiment with obfuscation. This was my gateway project for everything 
else. The code got really bad too, because everything was just tacked on 
in a rush, but I think it's acceptable. I learned a lot and I think I 
came up with a few clever things here, but nothing about it was 
mindblowing.


I think my number obfuscation, given how simple it was, is probably the 
most effective part.


Huge kudos to stravant for this.
